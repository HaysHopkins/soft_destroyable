SoftDestroyable
===============

Allows one to annotate an ActiveRecord module as being soft_destroyable.

== Why another soft_destroy implementation?

This gem was inspired by "acts_as_paranoid":http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid and
"rails3_acts_as_paranoid":https://github.com/goncalossilva/rails3_acts_as_paranoid, both of which are great gems.
I found that rails3_acts_as_paranoid did not handle associations the way I wanted (at least at the time I wrote this),
so I wrote this implementation instead.   

== Details

This changes the behavior of the +destroy+ method to become a soft-destroy, which
will set the +deleted_at+ attribute to <tt>Time.now</tt>, and the +deleted+ attribute to <tt>true</tt>
It exposes the +revive+ method to reverse the effects of +destroy+.
It also exposes the +destroy!+ method which can be used to <b>really</b> destroy an object and it's associations.

Standard ActiveRecord destroy callbacks are _not_ called, however you can override +before_soft_destroy+, +after_soft_destroy+,
and +before_destroy!+ on your soft_destroyable models.

Standard ActiveRecord dependent options :destroy, :restrict, :nullify, :delete_all, and :delete are supported and will
behave as expected.  +revive+ will _not_ undo the effects of +nullify+, +delete_all+, and +delete+.
+restrict+ is _not_ effected by the +deleted?+ state.  In other words, deleted child models will still restrict
destroying the parent.

The +delete+ operation is _not_ modified by this module.

The operations: +destroy+, +destroy!+, and +revive+ are automatically delegated to the dependent association records.
in a single transaction.

Scopes are provided for +deleted+ and +not_deleted+.   The standard +all+ scope is not polluted, so will still
return all records, deleted or not.

== Examples

* Migrate your model to add +deleted+ and +deleted_at+ attributes.   There are helpers provided for this:

create_table :mytable do |t|
 t.soft_destroyable
end

change_table :mytable do |t|
 t.soft_destroyable
end

* Annotate your model to be soft_destroyable

  class Parent
    has_many :children, :dependent => :restrict
    has_many :animals, :dependent => :nullify
    soft_destroyable

* That's it!

== Testing

* make sure you have rails and sqlite gems installed.
* rake test

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
